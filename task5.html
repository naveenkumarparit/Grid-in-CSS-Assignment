<!-- Task5: Explain the difference between `justify-items` and `justify-self` using code examples. 
     Solution: `justify-items`: This property is applied to the grid container and affects all the grid items inside it.
               `justify-self`: This property is applied to individual grid items, allowing you to override the justify-items value for a specific item -->

<!-- "In this code, I've applied the property `justify-items` to all the items in the container and `justify-self` to the item with the class 'gray'. As a result, all the items will be centered within the container, but the item with the class 'gray' will be positioned at the end of the container. This is because the `justify-self` property takes precedence over `justify-items` since it is defined later in the stylesheet." -->
